# Weather Application (WeatherNow)

The user can enter a location in a search bar, and the app will display the current temperature, weather description, feels like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app also includes a link to the location's Wikipedia page, as well as an attribution footer. The code uses React hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage state and handle API requests. It also makes use of the axios library to fetch data from the OpenWeather API. This app can be a great addition to your portfolio as it demonstrates your skills in building a functional React application that consumes data from an external API.
